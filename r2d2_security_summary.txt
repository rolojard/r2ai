==================================================

Assessment completed: 2025-09-20T10:45:54.066396
Platform: NVIDIA Orin Nano

OVERALL SECURITY STATUS:
------------------------------
Status: CONVENTION_READY
Security Score: 90/100
Total Checks: 12
Critical Issues: 0
High Risk Issues: 1

DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------------------------------
• Deploy with confidence for convention guest interactions
• Implement recommended safety protocols
• Monitor system during operation
• Maintain emergency stop procedures

DETAILED SECURITY ANALYSIS:
----------------------------------------

Guest Interaction Safety:
  ✓ Servo Safety Hardware: Found 5 PWM controllers with hardware limits
  ℹ Servo Movement Safety: Hardware PWM frequency limits prevent dangerous speeds; Software position limits can be implemented; Emergency stop via PWM disable available
  ℹ Emergency Stop Hardware: GPIO devices available for emergency stop implementation: /dev/gpiochip0, /dev/gpiochip1
  ℹ Physical Safety Requirements: Physical emergency stop button required; Motion detection for guest proximity; Soft-start servo movements to prevent sudden motion; Visual indicators for R2D2 operational status
  ℹ Emergency Stop Capabilities: Multiple emergency stop methods: PWM emergency disable available, Audio emergency stop via process termination, GPIO emergency shutdown available

System Security:
  ⚠ Network Exposure: Multiple external services detected: 0.0.0.0:111, 0.0.0.0:22, :::111, :::22
  ✓ File Permissions: Critical files properly secured: 4 files checked
  ✓ Dangerous Services: No dangerous unencrypted services running
  ✓ User Account Security: All accounts have proper password hashes

Test Result Authenticity:
  ✓ Test File Authenticity: Test files contain 6 authentic system indicators
  ✓ System Information Consistency: ARM64 architecture confirmed; NVIDIA Tegra platform confirmed
  ℹ Hardware Detection Consistency: 7 I2C buses detected; 4 SPI devices detected; GPIO subsystem operational
