I2C/Serial Command Structure
How to Make Your HPs Do Some Unique Things
Command Structure
Most of the commands available to to you over I2C or Serial communication come in the form of a 4-5 character
alphanumeric string . This string uses a well defined composition utilizing the following structure:

DT##C or DT##CS or DT##P or DT## or DT###
D - the HP designator; used to select the specific HP you wish to send the command to.
 Value Options: F - Front HP
 R - Rear HP
 T - Top HP
 A - All 3 HPs
T - the Sequence Type;
 Value Options: 0 - LED Function
 1- Servo Function

 ## - the Sequence Value (including leading zero);
 LED Sequences
 Value Options: 01 - Leia Sequence, Random shades of blue to mimic Leia Hologram*
 02 - Color Projector Sequence, Like Leia above using color command value
 03 - Dim Pulse Sequence, Color slowly pulses on and off (color & speed options)
 04 - Cycle Sequence, using color command value
 05 - Short Circuit, Led flashes on and off with interval slowing over time
 06 - Toggles Color, Simply sets LEDs to solid color value.
 07 - Rainbow Sequence*
 96 - Clears LED, Disables “Off Color”, Disables Auto LED Sequence*
 971 - Clears LED, Disables “Off Color”, Enables Auto LED Sequence using Default Sequences*
 972 - Clears LED, Disables “Off Color”, Enables Auto LED Sequence using Random Sequences*
 98 - Clears LED, Enables “Off Color”, Disables Auto LED Sequence*
 991 - Clears LED, Enables “Off Color”, Enables Auto LED Sequence using Default Sequences*
 992 - Clears LED, Enables “Off Color”, Enables Auto LED Sequence using Random Sequences*
 * Color Value Below Unneeded, Therefore Ignored, Can Be Omitted From Command String

 Servo Sequences
 Value Options: 01 - Sends HP to a Preset Position (requires position value)*
 02 - Enables RC Control on HP (Left/Right)*
 03 - Enables RC Control on HP (Up/Down)*
 04 - Sends HP to a Random Position
 05 - Wags HP Left/Right*
 06 - Wags HP Up/Down*
 98 - Disables Auto HP Twitch
 99 - Enables Auto HP Twitch
 *Function disabled or severely limited when Basic HP Positioning in enabled.
Guide to Using Your FlthyHPs v1.8 2

C - Color Value from the list below:
 Value Options: 1 - Red
 2 - Yellow
 3 - Green
 4 - Cyan (Aqua)
 5 - Blue
 6 - Magenta
 7 - Orange
 8 - Purple
 9 - White
 0 - Random
S - (optional), speed setting integer for the Dim Pulse LED function below (0-9)
P - (optional), the Position integer value from list below:
Preset Position Integer Values
 0 = Down
 1 = Center
 2 = Up
 3 = Left
 4 = Upper Left
 5 = Lower Left
 6 = Right
 7 = Upper Right
 8 = Lower Right
Some Simple Examples:
“R0063” - This toggles the Rear HP LEDs to Green (R/0/06/3)
“F0036” - This pulses the front HP LEDs in Magenta (F/0/03/6)
“T007” - This starts the Rainbow sequence in the Top HP LEDs. (T/0/07)
“A098” - This clears the LEDs in all 3 HPs and disables the LED auto twitch mode. (A/0/98)
“F103” - This sends the Front HP to the UP position. (F/1/03)
“A101” - This sends all three HPs to the center position. (A/1/01)
“R104” - This enables RC mode on the rear HP. (R/1/04)
“T1991” - This enables the Servo auto twitch mode. (T/1/99)
Important: Command strings sent via Serial communication require the addition of a carriage return character (\r)
to the end of the command string. So the command string “R0063” from the examples above, would become
“R0063\r” when using serial communication. This carriage return character lets the system know it has reached the
end of a command.

HCR Commands
Commands

Commands can be sent over Serial, UART, or I2C. All commands must be wrapped in a container:  <...>

To send multiple commands at once, include them within a single container separated by commas: <...,...>

...or chain multiple containers in a single string: <...><...>
