## System Requirements

### Server Setup
- Node.js with WebSocket support
- Python 3.x for servo control scripts
- Pololu Maestro servo controller (compatible with Mini 12, 18, 24)

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with WebSocket support
- Recommended: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Mobile/Tablet: iOS Safari, Android Chrome

### Hardware Requirements
- USB connection to Pololu Maestro board
- Adequate power supply for servo loads
- Optional: Touch screen for optimal control experience

## WebSocket Communication

The dashboard communicates with the backend through WebSocket connections:

### Connection Endpoints
- **Main Dashboard**: `ws://localhost:8766`
- **Vision System**: `ws://localhost:8767` (if using vision integration)

### Message Types
- `servo_command`: Individual servo position commands
- `sequence_command`: Sequence playback commands
- `emergency_stop`: Emergency stop commands
- `config_update`: Configuration change notifications

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
1. Verify server is running on port 8765
2. Check WebSocket connection status indicators
3. Ensure servo board is properly connected
4. Verify USB permissions for board access

### Performance Issues
1. Reduce update rate if experiencing lag
2. Close unnecessary browser tabs
3. Check system load indicators
4. Verify adequate power supply for servos

### Servo Issues
1. Check servo board detection status
2. Verify servo connections and power
3. Test individual servos before sequences
4. Use emergency stop if servos behave unexpectedly
