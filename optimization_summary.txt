RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------
• System requires additional optimization before R2D2 deployment
• Review failed optimizations and system requirements
• Configure R2D2 processes with real-time priority: chrt -f 50 python3 r2d2_controller.py
• Monitor thermal performance during extended operation
• Test servo response time under full load before convention
• Implement watchdog monitoring for critical R2D2 processes
