Real-time computer vision system for R2D2 with live webcam feed, YOLO object detection,
and integrated dashboard interface. Features live video streaming, detection overlays,
and real-time performance monitoring.

📋 Components
-------------
1. r2d2_realtime_vision.py    - Main vision system with YOLO detection and WebSocket streaming
2. dashboard_with_vision.html - Enhanced dashboard with live video feed and detection display
3. dashboard-server.js        - Node.js server for dashboard and WebSocket communication
4. start_vision_dashboard.py  - Launcher script to start all components
5. test_vision_setup.py       - Setup validation and testing script

🚀 Quick Start
--------------
1. Run system validation:
   python3 test_vision_setup.py

2. Start the complete system:
   python3 start_vision_dashboard.py

3. Open your browser to:
   http://localhost:8765

🔌 Network Ports
----------------
- Dashboard Web Interface: http://localhost:8765
- Dashboard WebSocket API: ws://localhost:8766
- Vision System WebSocket: ws://localhost:8767

📊 Dashboard Features
--------------------
✅ Live webcam video feed with real-time object detection
✅ Detection overlay with bounding boxes and confidence scores
✅ Live detection results list with object classes and coordinates
✅ Real-time performance metrics (FPS, detection time, total detections)
✅ Adjustable confidence threshold slider
✅ System monitoring (CPU, memory, GPU, temperature)
✅ R2D2 system status and control panel
✅ Automatic reconnection for both dashboard and vision systems

🎮 Vision Controls
------------------
- Start Vision: Connect to vision system
- Capture Frame: Save current frame (feature ready for implementation)
- Toggle Detections: Show/hide detection results display
- Confidence Slider: Adjust detection confidence threshold (0.1 - 1.0)

📈 Performance Metrics
----------------------
- Live FPS counter
- Detection processing time
- Total objects detected
- GPU memory usage monitoring
- Real-time system performance stats

- WebSocket-based video streaming with base64 encoding
- Multi-threaded processing for concurrent frame capture and detection
- CUDA acceleration when available
- Automatic frame queue management to prevent lag
- Graceful reconnection handling

🎭 Object Detection
------------------
- COCO dataset classes (80 object types)
- Configurable confidence threshold
- Real-time bounding box overlay
- Color-coded detection classes
- Coordinate display for each detection

📱 System Requirements
---------------------
- NVIDIA Orin Nano with CUDA 12.6
- PyTorch 2.5.0+ with CUDA support
- OpenCV 4.x with camera support
- Ultralytics YOLO (YOLOv8)
- WebSockets library
- Node.js for dashboard server

🔍 Testing & Validation
-----------------------
The system includes comprehensive testing:
- Hardware compatibility validation
- CUDA and PyTorch integration testing
- Camera access verification
- YOLO model loading and inference testing
- WebSocket server functionality testing

🎯 Usage Examples
-----------------
1. Convention Monitoring: Real-time detection of people, costumes, and objects
2. R2D2 Interaction: Visual feedback for guest interactions
3. Security Monitoring: Crowd detection and monitoring
4. Performance Analytics: System performance optimization

🛠️ Troubleshooting
------------------
If camera not detected:
- Check USB camera connection
- Verify camera permissions
- Try different camera index in code

If YOLO model fails to load:
- Ensure internet connection for initial model download
- Check CUDA memory availability
- Verify PyTorch CUDA installation

If WebSocket connection fails:
- Check port availability (8766, 8767)
- Verify firewall settings
- Ensure all components are running

📞 Support
----------
For issues or improvements, check the validation output and system logs.
All components include comprehensive error handling and logging.
