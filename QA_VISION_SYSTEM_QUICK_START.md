# QA Vision System Quick Start Guide

**Status:** ✓ READY FOR TESTING
**Date:** October 22, 2025

---

## Quick Test Commands

### 1. Verify Camera is Working (5 seconds)
```bash
cd /home/rolo/r2ai
python3 -c "import cv2; cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0, cv2.CAP_V4L2); print('Camera OK' if cap.isOpened() else 'FAIL'); cap.release()"
```
**Expected:** `Camera OK`

### 2. Run Camera Test Suite (15 seconds)
```bash
cd /home/rolo/r2ai
python3 test_camera_initialization_fix.py
```
**Expected:** `Total: 5 tests | Passed: 5 | Failed: 0`

### 3. Run Live System Test (20 seconds)
```bash
cd /home/rolo/r2ai
python3 test_vision_system_live.py
```
**Expected:** `✓ ALL TESTS PASSED - VISION SYSTEM IS FULLY FUNCTIONAL`

### 4. Start Vision System
```bash
cd /home/rolo/r2ai
python3 r2d2_orin_nano_optimized_vision.py
```
**Expected:** Server starts on port 8767, camera initializes successfully

## What to Look For

### Startup Success Indicators
```
✓ "TensorRT engine loaded successfully"
✓ "Camera parameter setup success rate: 7/7"
✓ "Camera configured: 640x480 @ 15.0fps"
✓ "Camera successfully initialized"
✓ "Starting hardware-optimized frame capture"
✓ "WebSocket server running on port 8767"
```

### Runtime Success Indicators
```
✓ FPS: 14-15 (capture)
✓ Frame stats show min=0, max=255, mean=100-120
✓ No "CAPTURED FRAME IS ALL BLACK" errors
✓ Total frames queued increasing
✓ No camera read failures
```

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Capture FPS:** 14-15 FPS (target: 15)
- **Frame resolution:** 640x480
- **Inference time:** <1000ms
- **Zero black frames**
- **Zero frame drops**

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to open camera device"
**Solution:** Check camera permissions and device availability
```bash
ls -la /dev/video*  # Should show video0, video1
groups  # Should include 'video' group
```

### Issue: "Model not found"
**Solution:** Verify TensorRT engine exists
```bash
ls -lh /home/rolo/r2ai/yolov8n_fp16.engine
```

### Issue: "Port already in use"
**Solution:** Kill existing process or use different port
```bash
lsof -i :8767  # Find process using port
kill <PID>     # Kill the process
```

## Test Checklist

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality
- [ ] Camera initializes without errors
- [ ] Frames are captured at 14-15 FPS
- [ ] No black frames in logs
- [ ] TensorRT model loads successfully
- [ ] WebSocket server starts on port 8767
- [ ] System runs for at least 60 seconds without crashes

### Phase 2: Performance
- [ ] Sustained 14-15 FPS for 5 minutes
- [ ] Frame quality is good (not washed out or grainy)
- [ ] Detection pipeline processes frames
- [ ] GPU memory usage is stable
- [ ] No memory leaks over time

### Phase 3: Stability
- [ ] 24-hour continuous operation
- [ ] Recovery from camera disconnect
- [ ] Graceful shutdown (Ctrl+C)
- [ ] Clean startup after restart
- [ ] No thread deadlocks

## Quick Validation (30 seconds)

Run this one-liner to validate everything:
```bash
cd /home/rolo/r2ai && python3 test_camera_initialization_fix.py 2>&1 | grep -E "(PASS|FAIL|Total:)"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ Camera Device Index: PASS
✓ Camera Device Path: PASS
✓ Camera Auto-Backend: PASS
✓ Camera Parameters: PASS
✓ Vision System Import: PASS
Total: 5 tests | Passed: 5 | Failed: 0
```

---

## Emergency Stop

If system needs to be stopped:
```bash
# Find the process
ps aux | grep r2d2_orin_nano

# Kill gracefully
pkill -f r2d2_orin_nano_optimized_vision.py

# Or force kill if needed
pkill -9 -f r2d2_orin_nano_optimized_vision.py
```
