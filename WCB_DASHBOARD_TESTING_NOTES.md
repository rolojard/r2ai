## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Vision Feed Dependency**
   - Dashboard works without vision system
   - Shows "Connecting to vision system..." placeholder
   - **Impact:** LOW - Vision is optional feature
   - **Workaround:** Dashboard fully functional without vision

2. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Tested: Chrome 120+, Firefox 121+, Edge 120+
   - **Impact:** LOW - Modern browsers well-supported
   - **Workaround:** Use Chromium-based browser for best experience

3. **Offline Mode**
   - Requires WCB API running on localhost:8770
   - No offline/cached mode available
   - **Impact:** MEDIUM - API must be running
   - **Workaround:** Start WCB API before opening dashboard

### Edge Cases Handled

✅ **API Temporarily Unavailable**
- Dashboard shows disconnected status
- Retries connection on next poll
- User can continue browsing UI

✅ **Mood Execution During Active Mood**
- New mood interrupts previous (based on priority)
- Higher priority moods override lower
- Emergency (priority 10) always interrupts

✅ **Network Latency**
- Status polling has 2-second timeout
- Failed requests don't crash UI
- Graceful degradation to disconnected state

✅ **Browser Tab Inactive**
- Polling continues in background
- Status updates when tab regains focus
- No memory leaks from background timers

## Browser Console Testing Commands

### Test Mood Execution
```javascript
// Execute specific mood
executeMood(5);  // Excited Happy

// Execute with custom priority
executeMood(27, 10);  // Emergency Panic (highest priority)

// Stop current mood
stopMood();
```

### Check API Status
```javascript
// Manual status check
fetch('http://localhost:8770/api/wcb/mood/status')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log);

// Execute mood and log response
fetch('http://localhost:8770/api/wcb/mood/execute', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({mood_id: 5, priority: 7})
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(console.log);
```

### Debug Vision Feed
```javascript
// Check WebSocket connection
console.log('Vision WebSocket:', visionWs);
console.log('Ready State:', visionWs.readyState);
// 0 = CONNECTING, 1 = OPEN, 2 = CLOSING, 3 = CLOSED
```

### Monitor Statistics
```javascript
// Log current statistics
console.log('Total Moods:', totalMoodsExecuted);
console.log('Total Commands:', totalCommandsSent);
console.log('Current Mood ID:', currentMoodId);
```
